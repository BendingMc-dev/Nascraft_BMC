  # Although taxation gets applied for buying and selling actions separately, the total tax paid is the same regardless of how it is split
  # The spread is determined by the deviation in both actions. In the default case, it is 6% for selling and 4% for buying, resulting in a total spread of 10%.

  # To avoid strengthening the underground economy, try to keep the taxation as low as possible.
  # Heavy taxation can encourage players to trade with each other directly, bypassing intermediaries,
  # and reducing the amount of money collected from taxes and making the market less efficient.
